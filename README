ShinyRawID adds a list to the django Raw-ID fields, which shows the elements in
the rawid field.

Works, at the moment, only for ManyToMany field.

It is buggy. Really.

Installation
------------

Take a look at the urls.py and admin.py of the testappshinyrawid.

You NEED to use "__shinyrawid" as the url-base for the urls.py include. The url
part is hardcoded in the javascript file.
